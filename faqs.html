<h3>Auto Policy Definitions</h3>
<p>Bodily Injury (BI) and Property Damage (PD)</p>

<p>Covers your liability for injuries you cause to other people and property damage for which
you are at fault.</p>

<p>This coverage usually
is expressed in a "split number" such as 100/300/100.
The first number is the limit (in thousands of dollars) that your
policy will pay for bodily injury per person in the event of an
accident. The second number is the total limit your policy will pay for
bodily injury to two or more people per accident.</p>

<p>The third number is the
limit that your policy will pay for property damage per accident.
Many people are underinsured today because of the rising costs of
vehicles (making it easy to exceed your Property Damage limits) and the
high personal injury awards in lawsuits.
Please consult us to make sure you have adequate converge- we'll be
happy to help you!</p>
